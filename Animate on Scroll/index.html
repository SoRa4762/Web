        It is said that "The things that you own end up owning you! Therefore,
        the only way you can be free is by losing everything you have and giving
        it to me so that I can be yours! and you ultimately own you! Hmm... that
        went from 0 to 100 real quick. But what i really mean is that you can
        only be free and gain the ability to do anything once you lose
        everything, that's about it bro."
